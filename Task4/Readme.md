1. Data Integration and Integrity

The project integrates multiple relational tables such as customers, orders, products, and categories using properly defined primary and foreign keys. This ensures data consistency, avoids redundancy, and maintains referential integrity across the database.

Insight: A well-designed relational schema is essential for accurate analytics and scalable database systems.

2. Revenue Concentration Analysis

The revenue analysis shows that a small subset of products contributes a large percentage of total sales. This reflects the Pareto principle commonly observed in retail and e-commerce systems.

Business Value: Organizations can prioritize high-revenue products for inventory planning, promotions, and supplier negotiations.

3. Customer Engagement Gap

Using LEFT JOIN operations, the analysis identifies customers who have never placed any orders. These inactive customers represent untapped business potential.

Business Value: Targeted marketing strategies such as discounts, onboarding offers, or personalized communication can be designed to convert these users into active customers.

4. Category-Wise Performance

By joining products with categories and orders, the project identifies which categories generate the highest and lowest revenue.

Strategic Impact: High-performing categories can receive more investment, while low-performing categories can be re-evaluated for pricing, bundling, or discontinuation.
