Overall Insights from the Analysis-

1- The dataset was first validated by checking column names and data types, ensuring that all numerical fields such as confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries were suitable for aggregation and visualization.

2- Bar chart analysis showed that COVID-19 cases are unevenly distributed across countries, with a few countries reporting significantly higher confirmed cases compared to others.

3- Region-wise aggregation highlighted clear differences in the overall impact of the pandemic across WHO regions, indicating geographic variation in spread and reporting.

4- Line chart visualization of weekly case changes revealed that some countries experienced sharp short-term increases, helping identify rapidly growing outbreak regions.

5- Trend-based analysis provided better insight into the current situation than cumulative totals, as it reflects recent changes rather than historical accumulation.

6- Histogram analysis of death counts showed a right-skewed distribution, meaning most countries reported relatively low deaths while a small number experienced very high fatalities.

7- Distribution-based visualization helped in understanding data spread and skewness, which is essential before applying any statistical or machine learning models.

8- Scatter plot analysis between confirmed cases and deaths indicated a strong positive relationship, where higher confirmed cases generally corresponded to higher deaths.

9- Correlation visualization helped identify which variables move together, supporting data-driven reasoning for feature selection in predictive modeling.

10- Overall, the visualizations transformed raw data into interpretable insights, enabling better understanding of patterns, trends, and relationships rather than relying solely on numerical tables.
