Month-over-Month Sales Insights:

1) Sales experienced an exceptional surge in April 2022, indicating a high-impact event such as a major promotion, seasonal demand spike, or large-scale campaign.

2) March 2022 shows relatively low sales volume, suggesting it may represent a partial data period or a baseline month before peak activity.

3) A decline in sales is observed from April to May 2022, indicating demand normalization following the April peak.

4) The continued decrease from May to June 2022 reflects a sustained downward trend, potentially driven by reduced promotions or market saturation.

5) Despite the month-over-month decline, sales levels in May and June remain significantly higher than March, indicating overall growth momentum compared to early periods.

6) High volatility in MoM growth highlights the dependency of sales performance on time-bound factors such as discounts, festivals, or marketing interventions.

7) The sharp positive MoM growth in April followed by consecutive negative growth months suggests a reactive sales pattern rather than steady organic growth.

8) These trends emphasize the need for consistent demand-generation strategies to stabilize revenue and reduce over-reliance on short-term sales spikes.
