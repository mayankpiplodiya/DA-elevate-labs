data cleaning pipeline for a Kaggle CSV dataset using Python and Pandas, where the raw dataset is downloaded, explored, and processed to identify and handle missing values, remove duplicates safely with a backup, standardize text fields, validate date, numeric, and categorical formats, and separate raw and cleaned data into different sheets; a Data_Quality_Notes column is added to capture analyst observations such as missing or inconsistent values, and the final output is saved as both an Excel file (with Raw_Data and Cleaned_Data sheets) and a cleaned CSV file(Final cleaned dataset ready for ML, SQL, or Power BI), making the dataset ready for reliable analysis, visualization, or machine learning.
