This project analyzes a retail sales dataset using SQL. The dataset was imported into a relational database with appropriate data types. SQL queries were written to verify data integrity, filter and sort transactions, generate category-wise sales summaries using aggregation functions, apply HAVING conditions for high-value categories, perform date-range analysis using BETWEEN, and conduct pattern matching with LIKE. The results were exported as CSV files, following industry-standard SQL analysis practices.
