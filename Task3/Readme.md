This project analyzes a retail sales dataset using SQL. The dataset was imported into a relational database with appropriate data types. SQL queries were written to verify data integrity, filter and sort transactions, generate category-wise sales summaries using aggregation functions, apply HAVING conditions for high-value categories, perform date-range analysis using BETWEEN, and conduct pattern matching with LIKE. The results were exported as CSV files, following industry-standard SQL analysis practices.

 Queries Included
- Verified data import using COUNT(*)
- Filtered and sorted high-value sales using WHERE and ORDER BY
- Generated category and region summaries using GROUP BY with SUM and AVG
- Applied HAVING to filter aggregated results
- Used BETWEEN for date-range analysis
- Used LIKE for customer name pattern search
